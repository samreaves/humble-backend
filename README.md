# humble-backend
My self taught journey into Java backend services, one feature at a time. This is all done in public out of radical transparency to show the world that I can learn quickly out of necessity.

## Objectives
My first project will be a Java service that stores transactions in Postgres.

The goal of this project is to learn hands on Java, JPA, Hibernate, Spring Boot, and using Postgres as a database with Java. I will write API endpoints to:
* get transactions by category
* get transactions by debit/credit
* post a new transaction

The second phase will be doing a migration, and learning how to do that properly. It will also show me how to "enrich" the csv data with additional properties.

In the third phase, I will create a second service that will need to ingest data from the first service, and learn all that comes with the complexity of ingestion using REST.

There may be more. This is the first commit.
